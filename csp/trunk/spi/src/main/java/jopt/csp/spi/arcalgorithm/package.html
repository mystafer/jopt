The heart of the constraint satisfaction functionality.
<p>
Contains the algorithm(s) used during the propagation of constraints and all of the related classes.
The related classes include the constraints and the variables upon which those constraints operate in
addition to the arcs and nodes and the graph into which the arcs and nodes are put.  Several supporting
structures including utilites and domains also form a significant component of this important package.
