The interfaces to all your searching needs.
<p>
Defines several interfaces (and some implementations) related to searching.  This includes interfaces 
for classes defining common search actions such as storing solutions or
adding constraints, common search techniques like breadth-first or depth-first, search goals like
maximize or minimize, and search limits based on elapsed time, number of failures, or other
criteria.  Also defines required operations for metaheuristics and neighborhoods - two essential elements
of local searching - in addition to a variety of other search-related resources.
