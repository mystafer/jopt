The interfaces for building, combining, and constraining variables and expressions
<p>
Offers classes for "making" constraint satisfaction problems.  Defines interfaces for integer, long,
double, float, and boolean forms of variables and expressions.  Defines the mathematical operations
commonly associated with aforementioned constructs and the format for defining constraints on them.
Also includes the concept of generic constants and expressions - 'generic' indicating the use of indexes
(commonly written as subscripts) to relate groups of variables like Xi or Yj (read "X sub i" or
"Y sub j," respectively).
